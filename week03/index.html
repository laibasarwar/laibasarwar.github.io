      While reading both of these articles, I was interested in the topics of the emerging web, media and photography.

          This article was a bit hard to read for me, but I liked part two the best. In this part, the authors main point on how technology advances was clearly pointed out with the photography metaphor. The process in which he explains the science behind each button or element of a camera, is amazing. Out of the whole article, I understood his writing style in this part. With not only going through each element, the author also adds in how each element is amazing in a scientific way. The shutter, in particular, it is crazy that a simple click can create multiple photographs. With just one simple click! He then tries going ahead to the possibilities of the future. The quote below shows how there is wet photography for exposure but maybe there can be a possibility of dry photography. I didn't even think of how important that can be in terms of innovations.
          <blockquote>
            Will there be dry photography? It is already here in two forms. When Brady made his Civil War pictures, the plate had to be wet at the time of exposure. Now it has to be wet during development instead. In the future perhaps it need not be wetted at all.

          I had a little more ease while reading this article. Although the language was still techical, I understood the topic a little better. I found the politics of web and the internet to be interesting. I didn't think that it was that important, the progresses of the web, but it does. The part in which the author talked about iTunes not being sharable. At one point, I thought that iTunes was right to be more private than Spotify. However with what the author said about how iTunes made a choice with that, I can clearly see the impact of the web and the issues with it.
          <blockquote>
            The iTunes world is centralized and walled off. You are trapped in a single store, rather than being on the open marketplace. For all the store’s wonderful features, its evolution is limited to what one company thinks up.
