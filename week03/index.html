      While reading both of these articles, I was interested in the topics of the emerging web, media and photography.

          For the first one, Berger goes through the basic history of photography and paintings, but what I found to be iconic, was when he focuses on the impact of a painting by zooming in with the camera with no background soung. He further goes on to this point by adding some peaceful music, to make the impact of the painting more peaceful. I thought that this was interesting, mainly because as someone who likes film and cinemetography, I understood the point that he made on how a camera can invoke feelings with just a simple sound or narration. Another thing that I was excited to see in this part, was at minute 20:15, Berger shows an image of girls dancing and then changes the camera to show Goyas famous Guerilla Warfare. This direct juxtaposition clearly shows the way that photographs can be shown, weather it is a happy image of dancing or war, when they are placed together, the mood can be changed in a matter of seconds.

          Part two is by far, my most favorite one! I never really studied art history before, so although it was new for me, I was not suprised to see how woman were portrayed, and it was more sad to me than interesting. With each painting that was discussed and shown, I liked the fact that Berger included a segment in which he let five woman to speak of their own reactions of the paintings. One woman spoke of how even though it is a portrait of a woman, she does not relate to it at all, or she does not see herself in the way that the woman is portrayed. I related to this since I too, don't see myself in the media that I view. For example, even though this part showed the viewpoints of five woman, they were all white, and as a South Asian woman, I don't see my own representation.
          A quote that I think was memorable from this part is:
          <blockquote>
